# RecipeParser

### I always look up random recipes online when I'm trying to cook something new, but there are so many ads, pictures, and other text that I don't really care about. So here I made a python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a recipe website for just the ingredients and the instructions. That way I only have to look at the information that I actually care about when trying to use a recipe online.


### I currently look for lists in the html that contain the name "ingredient" or "direction" in their id or classname
### TODO: Find another way to parse websites that don't use lists for their ingredients or directions
